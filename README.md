Senior Project 2018
The code for this phonegap project we wrote is in the www folder. This project was created using phonegap
To test the app you can download phonegap and replace the www folder of a blank phonegap app with this 

Also the error feedback is set to very hich right now as to demonstrate the backtracking capabilities of the app
This can be easily changed by editing the localstorage.js file
